## REGULAR DJANGO VIEWS AND SIMILER TO DJANGO FORMS API

This laptops app -> Contains functioning Web API with Writing regular Django views using our Serializer.

We're doing okay so far, we've got a serialization API that feels pretty similar to Django's Forms API, and 
some regular Django views.

Our API views don't do anything particularly special at the moment, beyond serving json responses, and there are
some error handling edge cases we'd still like to clean up, but it's a functioning Web API.
