## USING GENERIC CLASS-BASED VIEWS 

Note: Only changed the views.py file when it compared to previous version v3_laptops

Using the mixin classes we've rewritten the views to use slightly less code than before,
but we can go one step further. REST framework provides a set of already mixed-in generic 
views that we can use to trim down our views.py module even more.

We've gotten a huge amount for free, and our code looks like good, clean, idiomatic Django.
